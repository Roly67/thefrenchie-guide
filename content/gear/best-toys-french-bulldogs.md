Welcome to the Frenchie toy graveyard. If you live with a French Bulldog, you know exactly what I'm talking about. That corner of the living room where deflated tennis balls, eviscerated squeaky toys, and formerly adorable plushies go to die. We've lost more stuffed animals than we care to count, and I'm fairly certain one of our dogs views every new toy as a personal challenge.

Here's the plot twist: it's not Jago, the chaos merchant, the agent of destruction, the dog who approaches life with all the subtlety of a small snorting bulldozer.

It's Buster. The calm gentleman. The dignified one. The dog who moves through life with quiet contemplation and measured decisions.

Buster is a secret toy assassin.

The problem is, most dog toys are designed for, well, *normal* dogs. Dogs with sensible snouts and proportionate jaws. French Bulldogs are magnificently odd creatures with short muzzles, powerful bites, and — in Buster's case — a determination to systematically dismantle anything that isn't made of solid rubber or industrial-grade nylon.

After three years of trial, error, and a small fortune spent on toys that lasted approximately seventeen minutes, we've finally cracked the code on what makes a genuinely good Frenchie toy. Not just one that survives, but one they'll actually play with more than once.

<!-- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Buster and Jago surrounded by toys (the survivors) -->

## What Makes a Good French Bulldog Toy?

### Size Matters (But Not How You Think)

French Bulldogs have this peculiar combination of a small mouth opening but incredibly powerful jaws. Tennis balls? Too big to properly grip. Tiny squeaky toys designed for "small breeds"? Choking hazards. You need toys that fit comfortably in their mouths without being small enough to swallow.

The sweet spot for most Frenchies is medium-sized toys, even though they're technically a small breed. Buster can just about manage a standard tennis ball, but he looks like he's trying to swallow a grapefruit. Give him something slightly smaller with better grip, and he's happy for hours.

### Durability: The Buster Test

We have a rigorous testing protocol here at Frenchie HQ. If Buster can't destroy it in the first session, it's approved. If it survives a week? That's basically the dog toy equivalent of a knighthood.

His fastest destruction record: a cuddly monkey toy. Two minutes flat. We're talking from "new toy!" to "eviscerated stuffing everywhere" in the time it takes to make a cup of tea. He approached it methodically — found the weakest seam, applied targeted jaw pressure, pulled, and boom. Monkey defeated. Buster victorious. Us wondering what we've done to deserve this.

Jago, meanwhile, carries his toys around gently, occasionally giving them a soft chew, and treats them like beloved companions. The chaos merchant is gentle with toys. The gentleman is a destroyer. We've made peace with this contradiction.

Look for toys made from:
- **Solid rubber** (not hollow cheap stuff) — the only thing Buster can't destroy
- **Reinforced stitching** on any plush toys (delays the inevitable by approximately 3 minutes)
- **Nylon designed for power chewers** — Buster respects a worthy opponent
- **Rope with proper braiding** (not those sad loosely-woven ones that last 40 seconds)

Our toy basket is kept **out of reach** on a high shelf because if Buster has unsupervised access, anything that isn't Kong or Nylabone will be systematically destroyed. We learned this after coming home to what can only be described as a plush toy massacre. He looked very pleased with himself. Jago looked confused about why Buster had destroyed his friends.

{{< callout type="warning" title="Buster Says" >}}
"I approach toys with the focused intensity they deserve. If they're not solid rubber, they're not worthy. The monkey knew what it was getting into."
{{< /callout >}}

### Safety First (Yes, Even for Tough Dogs)

French Bulldogs are brachycephalic, which is a fancy way of saying they have squashed faces and compromised airways. This means:

- **No standard tennis balls for intense fetch** – the fuzz can make breathing harder
- **Avoid anything too small** that could lodge in their throat
- **Check for sharp edges** on harder toys
- **Remove any detachable parts** before you hand it over

We learned this the hard way when Buster got over-excited with a regular ball and couldn't catch his breath properly. Switched to breathable fetch balls and the problem vanished.

Buster once found a rubber duck (not a dog toy, just... a rubber duck that had migrated from the bathroom somehow) and systematically deflated it. Not in a violent way — very methodically, very precisely, like he was performing a controlled demolition. Jago watched with what can only be described as concern for the duck's wellbeing.

## The Buster vs Jago Toy Test

Every toy that enters our house undergoes the dual test. 

**Buster's Criteria:**
- Is it dignified enough for a gentleman?
- Can I carry it regally?
- Will it offend my sensibilities?
- What's the squeaker-to-dignity ratio?

**Jago's Criteria:**
- CAN I EAT IT?
- DOES IT BOUNCE?
- CAN I MAKE IT SQUEAK REPEATEDLY AT 6AM?
- WHAT IF I JUST... *DESTROY*?

If a toy can satisfy both the distinguished gentleman and the agent of chaos, it's genuinely special.

## Best Chew Toys for French Bulldogs

### 1. KONG Classic (Medium)

{{< tested-badge >}}

{{< product-card 
  name="KONG Classic Dog Toy (Medium, Red)"
  image="/images/products/amazon-b000ayn7lu.jpg"
  rating="4.5"
  price="£8.28"
  where="Amazon UK"
  url="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000AYN7LU?tag=broadbandhelp"
  affiliate="true" >}}

The KONG Classic is the gold standard for a reason. Made from ultra-durable natural rubber, it's virtually indestructible (even Buster has met his match). The hollow centre is perfect for stuffing with treats, peanut butter, or frozen kibble – which transforms this from a chew toy into a 30-minute mental workout.

This is one of the boys' absolute favourites. Buster chews his with the focused determination of someone trying to crack a safe. Jago carries his around like a trophy. The KONG survives both approaches, which is why we own four of them.

**Why Frenchies love it:** The irregular bounce keeps it unpredictable, and you can adjust the difficulty by what you stuff inside. Buster treats it with the respect one gives a worthy adversary — he can't destroy it, so he's chosen to work *with* it for treats instead. Jago just loves that it bounces and occasionally dispenses food.

**Sizes for Frenchies:** Medium is perfect for most adult Frenchies. Puppies should start with the KONG Puppy (softer rubber).

**Pro tip:** Freeze it with wet food or broth inside for a summer cooling treat. Keeps them occupied and helps manage the Cornwall heat (all three days of it).

{{< /product-card >}}

### 2. Nylabone Power Chew DuraChew

{{< product-card 
  name="Nylabone Power Chew DuraChew Textured Ring"
  image="/images/products/amazon-b003almw0m.jpg"
  rating="4.3"
  price="£15.27"
  where="Amazon UK / Pets at Home"
  url="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B003ALMW0M?tag=broadbandhelp"
  affiliate="true" >}}

For the serious chewers (hi, Jago), Nylabone's Power Chew range is purpose-built for dogs with powerful jaws. These aren't edible, but they're designed to be gnawed on for months without splintering or breaking into dangerous chunks.

**Why it works:** The textured surface helps clean teeth and massage gums as they chew. Jago's dental check-ups have genuinely improved since we introduced these. The flavours (bacon, chicken, peanut butter) keep them interested, though I suspect they're more suggestion than actual taste.

**Important:** These are for chewing, not eating. If your Frenchie is an aggressive destroyer who tries to *consume* everything, supervise the first few sessions. Most Frenchies are happy to gnaw away contentedly.

**Buster's verdict:** "Acceptable. The bacon flavour is a gentleman's choice."

{{< /product-card >}}

### 3. KONG Extreme (For Destroyers)

{{< product-card 
  name="KONG Extreme Dog Toy (Medium, Black)"
  image="/images/products/amazon-b0002ar0ii.jpg"
  rating="4.6"
  price="£12.24"
  where="Amazon UK"
  url="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0002AR0II?tag=broadbandhelp"
  affiliate="true" >}}

If the standard KONG Classic doesn't last long in your house, meet the Extreme. Made from KONG's toughest black rubber compound, this is designed for the Jagos of the world.

**The difference:** Harder rubber, more resistant to determined chewing. Everything else is the same – same shape, same treat-stuffing capabilities, same satisfying bounce.

**When you need it:** If your Frenchie has destroyed a regular KONG (rare but possible), or if they're just relentless power chewers. It's a few quid more but will last significantly longer.

Buster has tested the Extreme extensively. It's held up. This is high praise. When Buster can't destroy something, we buy multiples.

## Best Interactive & Puzzle Toys for French Bulldogs

French Bulldogs are smarter than people give them credit for. Sure, Jago's primary hobby is chaos, but he can figure out a Level 2 puzzle in about three minutes flat. Mental stimulation is just as tiring as physical exercise – and much safer for brachycephalic breeds who can overheat easily.

### 4. Nina Ottosson Dog Brick (Level 2)

{{< tested-badge >}}

{{< product-card 
  name="Nina Ottosson Dog Brick Puzzle Toy"
  image="/images/products/amazon-b0711y9xtf.jpg"
  rating="4.3"
  price="£20.03"
  where="Amazon UK / VioVet"
  url="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0711Y9XTF?tag=broadbandhelp"
  affiliate="true" >}}

This is hands-down Buster's favourite toy. The Dog Brick has flip-up compartments and sliding panels that hide treats. Your Frenchie has to work out the sequence to access the rewards. It's like Sudoku for dogs, but with cheese.

**What makes it brilliant:** Three different challenge types in one toy. Start easy (flip the lids), then add the bone-shaped blockers, then make them slide the panels. You can adjust difficulty based on your dog's patience level.

**Frenchie-friendly features:** Large, easy-to-manipulate pieces perfect for short snouts. Non-slip base means it won't slide around your kitchen floor (learned that lesson with cheaper alternatives). Dishwasher safe because treat-smeared plastic is grim.

**Reality check:** Jago solved it in five minutes the first time. Then spent another ten minutes checking if there was a way to cheat the system. There wasn't. He respected that.

{{< /product-card >}}

### 5. Snuffle Mat

{{< product-card 
  name="Snuffle Mat for Dogs (Medium/Large)"
  image="/images/products/amazon-b09wvrbk61.jpg"
  rating="4.2"
  price="£12.98"
  where="Amazon UK"
  url="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09WVRBK61?tag=broadbandhelp"
  affiliate="true" >}}

This looks like a shaggy rug had a baby with a dog toy. Hide kibble or treats in the fabric strips, and your Frenchie has to sniff them out. It's based on foraging behaviour and absolutely *exhausts* them mentally.

**Why Frenchies need this:** Sniffing and foraging is calming, instinctual behaviour. Particularly good for anxious dogs or rainy days when walks are miserable (so, Cornwall, most of the year).

**How to use it:** Start easy – treats visible on top. Gradually hide them deeper in the fabric. On a good day, this keeps Buster occupied for 20 minutes and Jago for about 8 (he's more of a "destroy the rug" merchant).

**Budget win:** Snuffle mats are one of the more affordable enrichment toys, and you can find handmade UK versions on Etsy if you fancy supporting small businesses.

{{< /product-card >}}

### 6. KONG Wobbler

{{< product-card 
  name="KONG Wobbler Interactive Treat Toy"
  image="/images/products/amazon-b07542nrbn.jpg"
  rating="3.6"
  price="£6.68"
  where="Pets at Home / Amazon UK"
  url="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07542NRBN?tag=broadbandhelp"
  affiliate="true" >}}

Imagine a Weeble (remember those? "Weebles wobble but they don't fall down"?) crossed with a treat dispenser. Your Frenchie bats it around, and kibble falls out of the hole at unpredictable intervals.

**The genius:** It slows down fast eaters, provides mental stimulation, and gives them a cardio workout without overheating. Jago has been known to herd this thing around the garden like a deranged sheepdog.

**Frenchie tip:** Start with easy-to-dispense treats so they understand the concept. Once they've got it, you can use their normal kibble to make mealtimes more interesting.

**Buster's review:** "Undignified but effective. I permit it."

## Best Fetch Toys for French Bulldogs

Now, let's address the elephant in the room: French Bulldogs and fetch is... *complicated*. Some Frenchies love it. Some will fetch exactly once, look at you with disdain, and expect you to fetch the thing *you* just threw. Madness.

Either way, if your Frenchie does enjoy fetch, you need the right tools.

### 7. Chuckit! Breathe Right Fetch Ball

{{< tested-badge >}}

{{< product-card 
  name="Chuckit! Breathe Right Fetch Ball (Medium, 2-Pack)"
  image="/images/products/amazon-b07d3fz15j.jpg"
  rating="4.4"
  price="£10.92"
  where="Amazon UK"
  url="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07D3FZ15J?tag=broadbandhelp"
  affiliate="true" >}}

Tennis balls are another favourite in our house, though we use these Breathe Right balls for actual fetch sessions. The hollow, lattice-like design allows air to flow through even when it's in your Frenchie's mouth. No more wheezing after three throws.

Regular tennis balls are fine for gentle play, but the breathable design makes these much safer for proper fetch with brachycephalic breeds.

**Why it's essential:** Regular tennis balls block airflow completely. These don't. Your Frenchie can breathe, run, and actually enjoy fetch without sounding like an asthmatic accordion.

**Durability:** Solid rubber construction means Jago can't destroy it (he's tried). Compatible with Chuckit! launchers if you want to throw further without your shoulder giving out.

**The catch:** This is for *fetch*, not intense chewing. Buster's fine leaving it alone, but if your Frenchie's a destroyer, don't leave them unattended with it.

{{< /product-card >}}

### 8. KONG Flyer (Soft Rubber Disc)

{{< product-card 
  name="KONG Flyer Rubber Frisbee"
  image="/images/products/amazon-b000brtadk.jpg"
  rating="4.5"
  price="£10.58"
  where="Pets at Home / Amazon UK"
  url="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000BRTADK?tag=broadbandhelp"
  affiliate="true" >}}

Frisbees and Frenchies shouldn't work together. Their jumping ability is... enthusiastic but imprecise. The KONG Flyer is made from soft rubber, so when Jago misjudges his leap and it hits him in the face (regularly), it doesn't hurt.

**Soft catch:** Gentle on teeth and gums. Buster prefers catching this to hard plastic frisbees.

**Fetching reality:** Jago treats this less like a frisbee and more like a very aerodynamic chew toy. We've made peace with it.

{{< /product-card >}}

## Best Comfort & Cuddle Toys

Yes, these are tough, muscular dogs with powerful jaws. They're also massive softies who like a cuddle buddy at bedtime.

### 9. KONG Wild Knots Bear

{{< tested-badge >}}

{{< product-card 
  name="KONG Wild Knots Bear (Medium/Large)"
  image="/images/products/amazon-b00b4ur08k.jpg"
  rating="4.2"
  price="£10.99"
  where="Amazon UK / The Range"
  url="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00B4UR08K?tag=broadbandhelp"
  affiliate="true" >}}

Soft and cuddly on the outside, but with an internal knotted rope skeleton for durability. Less stuffing means less mess when (not if) Buster decides to investigate its structural integrity.

**Why Jago approves:** He carries this around like a comfort blanket. Sleeps with it. Would probably marry it if dog-plushie marriage were legal. Treats it with genuine affection.

**Why it survives Buster:** The internal rope skeleton means even when he's testing the plush exterior, there's something durable underneath. Also, the squeaker is well-hidden and hard to access. He managed to extract it once (impressive engineering), but it took him three weeks of determined effort. We bought a replacement. The cycle continues.

**Colour note:** You can't choose the colour – they send what's in stock. Buster got blue. He's fine with it.

{{< /product-card >}}

### 10. ZippyPaws Skinny Peltz (No Stuffing Plush)

{{< product-card 
  name="ZippyPaws Skinny Peltz Fox"
  image="/images/products/amazon-b0002asnac.jpg"
  rating="4.4"
  price="£12.07"
  where="Amazon UK"
  url="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0002ASNAC?tag=broadbandhelp"
  affiliate="true" >}}

These long, thin plush toys have squeakers in the head and tail but zero stuffing in the body. When your Frenchie inevitably "kills" it, there's no polyfill explosion all over your living room.

**The appeal:** Perfect size for carrying around, shaking violently (Jago's favourite game), or cuddling. Comes in different animals – fox, raccoon, squirrel.

**Longevity:** Not indestructible, but they're cheap enough that replacing one every few months doesn't hurt. Think of them as consumable entertainment.

## Best Budget Pick: Tennis Ball Alternative

### The £3 Hero: Standard Rubber Ball

{{< product-card 
  name="Rosewood Rubber Ball with Rope (Medium)"
  image="/images/products/amazon-b00p0yqyyw.jpg"
  rating="4.5"
  price="£16.14"
  where="Pets at Home / The Range"
  url="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00P0YQYYW?tag=broadbandhelp"
  affiliate="true" >}}

Look, not every toy needs to cost £15. A good quality rubber ball with a rope attached is simple, effective, and costs less than a fancy coffee.

**What it does:** Bounces irregularly, rope makes it easy to throw and play tug, solid rubber means it lasts.

**What it doesn't do:** Anything fancy. No treat-dispensing, no puzzles. Just a ball. Sometimes that's enough.

**Jago's take:** "Ball is ball. Ball is life."

## Toys to AVOID with French Bulldogs

We've learned these lessons so you don't have to.

### ❌ Standard Tennis Balls (for extended play)

The fuzzy exterior holds onto saliva and dirt, creating a breathing obstruction for flat-faced dogs. Fine for supervised play, terrible for extended fetch sessions.

### ❌ Rawhide Chews

Controversial opinion incoming: rawhide is rubbish. It becomes a choking hazard when soggy, and many dogs (Jago included) try to swallow massive chunks. There are better chew options.

### ❌ Small Rubber Squeaky Toys

Those little latex squeaky toys? Choking hazard waiting to happen. Jago can fit an entire small rubber chicken in his mouth. We no longer own small rubber chickens.

### ❌ Cheaply Made Rope Toys

If the rope frays into individual threads easily, your Frenchie will eat them. Intestinal blockage risk. Invest in properly braided, reinforced rope toys or skip them entirely.

### ❌ Toys with Glued-On Parts

Eyes, noses, decorative bits glued onto plush toys – all will be eaten. If it's not stitched or embedded into the toy, assume it will become a snack.

### ❌ Anything Smaller Than a Golf Ball

Obvious choking hazard. Even if your Frenchie *can* fit it in their mouth, they shouldn't.

{{< callout type="warning" title="Emergency Reminder" >}}
If your Frenchie swallows something they shouldn't, call your vet immediately. Don't wait to see if it passes. French Bulldogs can't vomit easily due to their anatomy, so foreign objects are extra dangerous.
{{< /callout >}}

We had one emergency vet visit when Buster (of course Buster) managed to detach and swallow a small plastic squeaker from a toy that was supposed to be "indestructible for power chewers." It wasn't. The vet was very professional about it. We were mortified. Buster was unrepentant. The squeaker passed naturally (thank god), and we now inspect every toy for detachable parts before purchase. If it's not one solid piece or designed to be indestructible, Buster doesn't get unsupervised access.

---

## How to Rotate Toys to Keep Them Interested

Here's a secret: your Frenchie doesn't need 47 toys available at once. They need variety *over time*.

**The rotation system:**

1. **Keep out 3-4 toys at a time** – one chew, one puzzle, one fetch, one comfort.
2. **Swap them weekly** – Put the current batch away, bring out toys they haven't seen for a bit.
3. **The "new toy" excitement** – Toys that have been in the cupboard for two weeks feel new again. It's like Christmas every week.

**What we do:** We have a "toy box" in the cupboard that Buster and Jago can't access. Every Sunday, we rotate. Keeps things interesting, keeps the house less cluttered, keeps them excited about playtime.

**Jago's opinion:** "Why do the toys go away? Are they on holiday? Can I eat the toy box?"

## Our Top 3 Overall Recommendations

After three years of extensive field testing (i.e., living with Buster and Jago), here are the three toys we'd buy if we could only choose three:

### 🥇 **1. KONG Classic (Medium)**
- **Why:** Versatile, virtually indestructible, treat-stuffable, dishwasher safe, favourite of both boys
- **Best for:** Every Frenchie, every day, especially destroyers like Buster
- **Price:** £8.79
- **Where:** Amazon UK

The KONG Classic is the foundation of a good Frenchie toy collection. It's the only toy Buster can't destroy, which means it's the only toy we allow him unsupervised access to. Stuff it with treats for mental stimulation, freeze it for teething puppies, or just let them chew. Both boys love these — we own four and they're all in active rotation. It's the Toyota Corolla of dog toys – reliable, practical, beloved, and crucially for our household, indestructible.

### 🥈 **2. Nina Ottosson Dog Brick**
- **Why:** Mental stimulation without overheating risk
- **Best for:** Smart Frenchies who need brain work
- **Price:** £19.99
- **Where:** Amazon UK / VioVet

Puzzle toys tire out your Frenchie's brain, which is safer and often more effective than intense physical exercise for brachycephalic breeds. The Dog Brick is durable, adjustable difficulty, and genuinely engaging.

### 🥉 **3. Chuckit! Breathe Right Ball**
- **Why:** Safe fetch for flat-faced breeds
- **Best for:** Frenchies who actually enjoy fetch (both of them)
- **Price:** £9.99
- **Where:** Amazon UK

If your Frenchie likes to play fetch, this is non-negotiable. The airflow design means they can breathe while playing, which is the bare minimum we should expect from a fetch toy.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What size toys should I get for a French Bulldog?

**Medium-sized toys** work best for most Frenchies. Even though they're a "small breed," their jaw strength and mouth shape suit medium toys better. Avoid anything small enough to swallow or so large they can't grip it properly.

### Are French Bulldogs heavy chewers?

**It varies wildly.** Buster is gentle and considered. Jago is a force of destruction who views every toy as a personal enemy. Most Frenchies fall somewhere in between. Start with durable options (KONG, Nylabone) and adjust based on your dog's chewing style.

### Can French Bulldogs play with tennis balls?

**For supervised, short sessions, yes.** For extended fetch or unsupervised chewing, no. The fuzzy coating can make breathing harder for brachycephalic dogs, and determined chewers (Jago) will de-fuzz them and potentially ingest the material. Opt for smooth rubber fetch balls instead.

### How do I stop my Frenchie from destroying every toy?

**You probably can't completely**, but you can manage it:
- Buy genuinely durable toys (KONG Extreme, Nylabone Power Chew)
- Rotate toys so they stay interesting
- Provide appropriate chew outlets so they're not bored
- Supervise with softer toys and put them away when you can't watch
- Accept that some destruction is normal and budget for replacements

### What's the best toy for a French Bulldog puppy?

**KONG Puppy (the pink or blue one)** is perfect for teething. It's softer than the adult version but still durable. Pair it with a simple rope toy and a soft plush for comfort. Avoid hard nylon chews until their adult teeth are in (around 6 months).

### Do French Bulldogs need puzzle toys?

**Absolutely.** Mental stimulation is crucial for Frenchies because intense physical exercise can be dangerous due to their breathing issues. Puzzle toys, snuffle mats, and treat-dispensing toys tire them out safely. A 15-minute puzzle session can be as effective as a 30-minute walk.

## Final Thoughts: Toys Are an Investment, Not an Expense

Look, I'll level with you. We've spent an obscene amount on dog toys over the years. Some lasted five minutes. Some are still going strong three years later. The difference isn't luck – it's understanding what actually works for French Bulldogs.

These aren't Labs who'll happily fetch a stick for hours. They're not Border Collies who need constant mental challenges. French Bulldogs are clever, stubborn, affectionate chaos gremlins who deserve toys designed for their unique needs.

The toys on this list are the survivors. The ones Buster carries around gently, the ones Jago has tried and failed to destroy, the ones that make rainy Cornwall days bearable, and the ones we'd buy again tomorrow if they disappeared.

Choose toys that are:
- ✅ **Safe** for short snouts and powerful jaws
- ✅ **Durable** enough to survive the Jago test
- ✅ **Engaging** enough to hold their attention
- ✅ **Size-appropriate** for their unique mouth shape

And when in doubt? Start with a KONG Classic. It's never let us down.

Now if you'll excuse me, Jago's found the toy cupboard and I need to explain rotation theory to a dog who thinks "mine" and "yours" are the same word.

{{< callout type="tip" title="How We Test Toys" >}}
Every toy in this guide has been tested by Buster and Jago in real-world conditions (the Cornish countryside, our living room, the local beach, and one memorable incident in Waitrose car park). We only recommend products we'd genuinely buy ourselves, and we update this guide regularly as we test new toys.
{{< /callout >}}

**Toy rotation system:** We keep the KONG toys, Nylabones, and tennis balls in constant circulation. Everything else goes in the high-shelf toy basket. Buster gets supervised playtime with plush toys because we know they won't last. Jago can have whatever he wants because he's surprisingly gentle (who knew?). This system works for us and saves a fortune on replacement toys.
