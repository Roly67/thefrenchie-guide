## Welcome to The Frenchie Guide! 🐾

If you're new here, you're in the right place. We're Buster & Jago's humans, and this is our labour of love for fellow French Bulldog owners.

### What We're About

Unlike generic dog sites, **The Frenchie Guide** focuses exclusively on French Bulldogs. We share:

✅ **Honest product reviews** — tested by our own Frenchies  
✅ **Practical care guides** — because Frenchies need special attention  
✅ **Real-world advice** — from owners who live with the breed daily  
✅ **UK-based insights** — but useful for Frenchie parents worldwide

### Who Are Buster & Jago?

They're our two French Bulldogs, living their best lives in Cornwall, UK. Every product we recommend has been tested on them. Every guide reflects what we've learned from raising, training, and caring for them.

- **Tell the truth** — If something doesn't work, we say so
- **Earn through affiliate links** — But only for products we genuinely recommend
