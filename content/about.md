## About Us

We're real French Bulldog owners, based in the beautiful county of Cornwall, UK. Our two Frenchies — **Buster** and **Jago** — are the stars (and the reason) behind this site.

### Meet the Frenchies

**Buster**  
*Age: [TBD]*  
*Personality: [TBD — add details about Buster's temperament, quirks, likes/dislikes]*

**Jago**  
*Age: [TBD]*  
*Personality: [TBD — add details about Jago's temperament, quirks, likes/dislikes]*

### Our Cornwall Connection

Based in Cornwall, we're lucky to have miles of beaches, coastal paths, and countryside to explore with our boys. Living here has taught us a lot about keeping Frenchies active and happy despite their limitations — from finding the right harness for clifftop walks to managing overheating on sunny beach days.

### Why We Started This Site

There's a lot of generic dog advice online, but French Bulldogs are special. They need specific gear (because of their build), specific care (because of their breathing), and specific understanding (because of their stubborn, lovable personalities).

We started The Frenchie Guide to share what we've learned from living with Buster and Jago — the products that actually work, the tips that save time and money, and the honest truth about Frenchie ownership.

### What Makes Us Different

- **We test everything ourselves** — Every product we recommend has been used by Buster and Jago.
- **We're honest** — If something doesn't work, we'll tell you.
- **We're based in the UK** — But we cover products available worldwide.
- **We earn from affiliate links** — But we only recommend what we'd buy again. See our [affiliate disclosure](/affiliate-disclosure/) for full transparency.
