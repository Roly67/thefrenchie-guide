By using The Frenchie Guide (https://thefrenchieguide.com), you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, please don't use the site.

### What this site is

The Frenchie Guide is a personal blog sharing our experience as French Bulldog owners. We write product reviews, care guides, and training tips based on our own experience with our dogs, Buster and Jago.

### Not professional advice

**Our content is not veterinary, medical, or professional advice.** Everything we share is based on personal experience as dog owners, not professional qualifications. Always consult a qualified veterinarian for health concerns about your dog.

We do our best to ensure our content is accurate and up to date, but we make no guarantees about its completeness, reliability, or suitability for your situation. Every dog is different.

### Affiliate links

Some links on this site are affiliate links. If you click one and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. This helps us keep the site running.

Affiliate relationships never influence our opinions. We only recommend products we've personally tested with our own dogs. For full details, see our [Affiliate Disclosure](/affiliate-disclosure/).
