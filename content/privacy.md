## Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 16 February 2026

### Who we are

The Frenchie Guide is a personal website run from Cornwall, United Kingdom. For the purposes of data protection law, we are the data controller.

**Contact:** hello@thefrenchieguide.com
**Website:** https://thefrenchieguide.com

### What data we collect and why

#### Analytics (with your consent)

If you accept analytics cookies, we use **Google Analytics 4** (provided by Google LLC) to understand how visitors use the site — which pages are popular, how long people stay, and how they found us. This helps us improve our content.

Google Analytics collects:
- Pages you visit and time spent on each
- Approximate geographic location (country/region level)
- Device type, browser, and operating system
- Referral source (how you arrived at the site)
- IP address (truncated by Google's anonymisation feature)

**Legal basis:** Your consent, given via our cookie banner. Analytics cookies are not set until you click "Accept."

#### Information you provide voluntarily

If you email us, we'll receive your email address and any information you include in your message. We use this solely to respond to your enquiry.

**Legal basis:** Legitimate interest (responding to correspondence).

#### Affiliate link tracking

When you click an affiliate link (e.g. to Amazon), the retailer may set their own cookies to track the referral. These are **third-party cookies** set by the retailer, not by us. We have no control over those cookies — please refer to the retailer's own privacy policy.

### Cookies {#cookies}

We only set cookies with your explicit consent. Here is a complete list:

#### Cookies we control

| Cookie | Purpose | Duration | Set when |
|--------|---------|----------|----------|
| `cookie-consent` | Remembers your Accept/Reject choice (stored in localStorage, not a cookie) | Persistent until cleared | You click Accept or Reject |

#### Google Analytics cookies (only if you accept)

| Cookie | Purpose | Duration |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `_ga` | Distinguishes unique visitors | 2 years |
| `_ga_H6DZ5HX101` | Maintains session state | 2 years |

#### Third-party cookies

Affiliate networks (Amazon Associates and others) may set their own cookies when you click an affiliate link. We do not control these cookies. See:
- [Amazon Privacy Notice](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909010)

#### Managing cookies

You can change your cookie preference at any time using the **Manage Cookies** link in our footer. You can also clear cookies through your browser settings.

### International data transfers

Google Analytics data is processed by Google LLC, based in the United States. Google operates under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and uses Standard Contractual Clauses as safeguards for data transferred outside the UK/EEA. For more detail, see [Google's privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### Data retention

- **Analytics data:** Google Analytics retains data for 14 months, after which it is automatically deleted.
- **Email correspondence:** We keep emails for as long as reasonably necessary to deal with your enquiry, then delete them.

### Your rights

Under UK data protection law (UK GDPR), you have the right to:

- **Access** your personal data
- **Correct** inaccurate data
- **Delete** your data ("right to be forgotten")
- **Restrict** or **object** to processing
- **Data portability** — receive your data in a portable format
- **Withdraw consent** at any time (e.g. by clicking "Manage Cookies" in the footer)

To exercise any of these rights, email us at hello@thefrenchieguide.com.

### How to complain

If you're unhappy with how we handle your data, you have the right to complain to the **Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)**:

- Website: [ico.org.uk](https://ico.org.uk/)
- Helpline: 0303 123 1113

### Children's privacy

Our site is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
