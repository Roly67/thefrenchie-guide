So you're bringing home a French Bulldog puppy. Congratulations! You're about to experience joy, chaos, sleep deprivation, and an alarming amount of conversations about faeces consistency.

I've done this twice now—once with Buster, who arrived as a dignified 10-week-old gentleman already judging my life choices, and again with Jago, who arrived as a brindle wrecking ball with seemingly no grasp of physics or consequences.

Both times, I bought things I didn't need. Both times, I didn't have things I desperately needed at 3 AM. Let me save you the trouble.

This is the *actual* French Bulldog puppy checklist—not the "buy everything in the pet shop" version that retailers want you to believe, but the "you'll genuinely need this" version based on real-world experience, British weather, and Frenchie-specific quirks.

## Before We Start: The Reality Check

French Bulldog puppies are not regular puppies. They have flat faces that make eating and drinking an adventure, ears that invite constant infection if you're not vigilant, wrinkles that need cleaning, and zero concept of temperature regulation.

They also cost an absolute fortune before you even bring them home (reputable breeders charge £2,000-£3,000 in the UK, and if someone's offering cheaper, run). Then there's the setup costs.

**Budget realistically:**
- Essential gear: £400-600
- First vet bills (vaccinations, microchip check, initial check-up): £150-200
- Food (first month): £40-60
- Emergency fund (because something *will* happen): £500 minimum

Right. Deep breath. Let's do this.

## The Absolute Non-Negotiables

These are things you need *before* puppy arrives. Not "I'll grab it tomorrow"—*before*.

### 1. Harness (NOT a Collar)

This is crucial for French Bulldogs. Their tracheas are vulnerable, and pulling on a collar can cause serious damage or exacerbate breathing issues.

{{< product-card 
    title="Ezydog Chest Plate Harness"
    description="Y-shaped front clip harness designed specifically for brachycephalic breeds. Distributes pressure across the chest, reducing strain on the throat. Reflective stitching for visibility. Multiple points of adjustment."
    url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE"
    price="£££"
>}}
**Why this one:** The Y-shape sits behind the front legs, not across the throat. Essential for flat-faced breeds. I've used these for both Buster and Jago—they're indestructible and properly designed.

**Sizing tip:** Measure your puppy's chest at the widest point. For Frenchie puppies (10-16 weeks), you'll likely need XXS-Small. They'll outgrow it. Accept this financial reality.
{{< /product-card >}}

{{< product-card 
    title="Puppia Soft Harness"
    description="Soft vest-style harness, lightweight and comfortable for puppies still learning to walk on lead. Comes in small sizes suitable for Frenchie pups. Easy step-in design."
    url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE"
    price="££"
>}}
**Alternative option:** If you want something gentler for very young puppies during initial lead training. Less robust than Ezydog but easier to get on a wriggly puppy.
{{< /product-card >}}

**Do NOT buy:**
- Retractable leads (terrible for training, dangerous for Frenchies who overheat)
- Anything that pulls on the neck
- "Gentle leader" head collars (not suitable for brachycephalic breeds)

### 2. Crate (Probably)

Controversial topic, I know. But crate training makes [our potty training guide](/training/french-bulldog-potty-training/) easier, provides a safe space, and prevents a lot of puppy destruction.

{{< product-card 
    title="MidWest iCrate Dog Crate - 24 inch"
    description="Fold-flat wire crate with divider panel (essential for puppies). Single-door or double-door options. Includes plastic tray. 24-inch size suitable for adult Frenchies."
    url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE"
    price="£££"
>}}
**Key feature:** The divider panel. Puppies shouldn't have too much space initially (they'll toilet in one corner and sleep in another). As they grow, you move the divider to increase space.

**Sizing:** 24-inch (61cm) crate is perfect for adult Frenchies. Don't go larger—they like cosy spaces.
{{< /product-card >}}

**What you'll also need:**
- Crate cover (blanket works fine) to make it den-like
- Comfortable bedding (see below)
- Water bowl that attaches to crate bars (they'll knock over anything else)

**Placement:** Not in a busy hallway where they'll never settle, not isolated in a basement where they feel abandoned. Somewhere they can see/hear household activity but isn't constant chaos. I put Buster's crate in the corner of the living room initially.

Buster's crate experience was almost suspiciously easy. First night: one woof. *One.* Then silence. After that, he treated the crate like his private members' club — went in voluntarily, curled up, and that was that.

Jago? Also surprisingly fine after that first night. The trick was cheesy wedges and bedtime biscuits. A predictable, calm bedtime routine with treats made the crate a place of good things rather than imprisonment. Every night: out for a wee, bedtime biscuit, into the crate, done. Pavlov would be proud.

### 3. Bedding (Washable, Indestructible-ish)

Puppies are disgusting. They'll wee on it, vomit on it, drag it through mud, and potentially eat it.

{{< product-card 
    title="Vet Bed - Non-Slip Washable Fleece"
    description="Original veterinary bedding. Super absorbent, moisture wicks away from puppy, machine washable at 60°C, virtually indestructible. Non-slip backing."
    url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE"
    price="££"
>}}
**Why vet bed is brilliant:** Stays dry on top even if puppy has an accident. Warm without overheating. Cannot be chewed into swallowable chunks (unlike memory foam). Lasts forever.

**Buy two:** One in the crate, one in the wash. This is not optional advice.
{{< /product-card >}}

**Skip for now:** Expensive orthopedic beds. Your puppy will destroy them. Wait until they're past the "everything is a chew toy" phase (12-18 months).

### 4. Food & Water Bowls (Elevated, Flat-Faced Friendly)

Regular deep bowls are challenging for flat-faced breeds. Food ends up everywhere, water goes up their nose, it's chaos.

{{< product-card 
    title="Neater Pets French Bulldog Bowl Set"
    description="Shallow, wide ceramic bowls specifically designed for flat-faced breeds. Reduces mess. Elevated stand (adjustable height). Prevents whisker stress and breathing interference."
    url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE"
    price="££"
>}}
**The flat-face factor:** Shallow bowls mean they don't have to shove their entire face into the food. Less snorting, less mess, less water inhalation.

**Material matters:** Ceramic or stainless steel. Plastic harbours bacteria and can cause chin acne (yes, this is a thing).
{{< /product-card >}}

### 5. Puppy Food (Whatever Breeder Was Feeding)

Do NOT immediately change your puppy's food. Their digestive systems are sensitive, and the stress of a new home already risks upset tummies.

**The plan:**
1. Get a supply of whatever the breeder was feeding (ideally 2-3 weeks worth)
2. After 7-10 days, if you want to transition to different food, do it gradually over 7-10 days
3. Mix increasing amounts of new food with decreasing amounts of old food

**What to feed eventually:**

{{< product-card 
    title="Royal Canin French Bulldog Puppy"
    description="Breed-specific formula designed for French Bulldog puppies. Kibble shaped for brachycephalic jaws. Supports digestive health and skin barriers. Suitable from 2-12 months."
    url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE"
    price="££££"
>}}
**Expensive but effective:** Specifically formulated for Frenchies' nutritional needs. The kibble shape genuinely makes eating easier for flat faces.
{{< /product-card >}}

{{< product-card 
    title="James Wellbeloved Puppy Food (Turkey & Rice)"
    description="UK brand, hypoallergenic, single protein source. Good for sensitive tummies. No added artificial colours, flavours or preservatives. More affordable than Royal Canin."
    url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE"
    price="£££"
>}}
**Solid alternative:** If your Frenchie has food sensitivities (common in the breed), this is gentler. Buster was on this initially before we switched to Royal Canin.
{{< /product-card >}}

**How much:** Follow packet guidelines based on weight. Weigh your puppy weekly. Frenchies should be chunky but not obese.

### 6. Treats (Small, Appropriate, Not Entire Meals)

Training treats should be:
- Tiny (pea-sized)
- High-value (they actually want them)
- Low-calorie (you'll use dozens daily)

{{< product-card 
    title="Pure Bites Freeze-Dried Training Treats"
    description="Single ingredient (chicken or liver), freeze-dried, breaks into tiny pieces. High protein, minimal calories. No additives. Smells revolting to humans, dogs love it."
    url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE"
    price="££"
>}}
**Training gold:** You'll go through these fast during toilet training and basic commands. Worth every penny.
{{< /product-card >}}

**Treats to avoid:**
- Anything with artificial colours
- Rawhide (choking hazard, digestive issues)
- Anything too hard (can break puppy teeth)
- Human food unless you enjoy diarrhoea clean-up at 4 AM

## Frenchie-Specific Essentials

These aren't on standard puppy checklists, but they absolutely should be for French Bulldogs.

### 7. Wrinkle Cleaning Supplies

Those adorable face folds? They collect moisture, food, dirt, and will develop infections if not cleaned regularly.

{{< product-card 
    title="Squishface Wrinkle Paste"
    description="Water-repellent barrier cream for skin folds. Creates barrier against moisture, yeast, and bacteria. Use after cleaning wrinkles. Lasts ages."
    url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE"
    price="£££"
>}}
**How to use:** Clean wrinkles with unscented baby wipe or damp cloth, dry thoroughly, apply thin layer of paste. Daily for deep wrinkles, every other day for shallower ones.

I swear by this stuff. Buster's deep nose wrinkle would be permanently gunky without it.
{{< /product-card >}}

**Also grab:**
- Unscented baby wipes (for daily cleaning)
- Cotton pads (for drying after cleaning)
- Veterinary ear cleaner (those bat ears need weekly attention)

Nobody warns you about the *smell.* The first time I lifted Buster's nose fold and got a whiff of what was lurking underneath, I genuinely questioned my life choices. It's like warm cheese that's been forgotten in a gym bag.

The lesson: clean the wrinkles daily from day one. Don't wait until something smells medieval. Make it part of the routine and your puppy will tolerate it. Leave it too long and you'll end up at the vet with an infected fold and a hefty bill. Trust me — routine prevention beats emergency treatment every time.

### 8. Temperature Management

French Bulldogs cannot regulate their body temperature effectively. This is not optional knowledge—it's life-or-death in hot weather.

{{< product-card 
    title="PawPride Cooling Mat"
    description="Self-cooling gel mat, no refrigeration needed. Activated by pressure. Various sizes - Small/Medium perfect for Frenchies. Helps prevent overheating during warm weather."
    url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE"
    price="££"
>}}
**UK weather caveat:** Yes, even in Britain. That one week in July when it hits 24°C? Your Frenchie will suffer without cooling aids.

Place in their crate or favourite rest spot. No electricity needed—pressure-activated gel.
{{< /product-card >}}

**Also consider:**
- Small fan for hot days (not pointed directly at them)
- Cooling bandana (soak in cold water, wear around neck)
- Frozen Kongs for hot days (cooling and entertaining)

**In winter:**
They get cold easily too. A lightweight fleece coat for walks isn't ridiculous—it's sensible.

### 9. ID Tag & Microchip Check

Your breeder should have microchipped your puppy. **Check it's registered to YOUR details** as soon as you get them.

{{< product-card 
    title="Engraved Dog ID Tag - Slide-On Style"
    description="Attaches directly to harness D-ring, won't dangle or make noise. Engraved with your phone number. Stainless steel, won't fade."
    url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE"
    price="£"
>}}
**Why slide-on:** Doesn't dangle or jingle (helpful for crate training). Can't fall off like hanging tags.

**What to engrave:**
- Your mobile number
- "I'm microchipped"
- Optionally: "Medical needs" if relevant

Don't put your puppy's name—you don't want strangers calling them by name if they escape.
{{< /product-card >}}

## Toys: The Good, The Pointless, and The Dangerous

Puppies need appropriate toys. Not "every toy in the shop," but targeted, safe options.

### What Actually Works:

{{< product-card 
    title="Kong Puppy (Small)"
    description="Soft blue rubber Kong designed for puppy teeth and jaws. Stuff with food, freeze for extended engagement. Virtually indestructible. The ultimate puppy sanity saver."
    url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE"
    price="££"
>}}
**Multi-purpose genius:** Mental stimulation, teething relief, meal timer, crate training aid, exhaustion tool. Buy three. Freeze them stuffed with wet food, peanut butter, or mashed banana.

I give Jago a frozen Kong before I need 20 minutes of peace. Works every time.
{{< /product-card >}}

{{< product-card 
    title="Nylabone Puppy Chew Toys"
    description="Specifically designed for puppy teeth (softer than adult versions). Textured for teething relief. Various shapes and sizes. Replace when heavily worn."
    url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE"
    price="££"
>}}
**Teething essential:** When puppy teeth are coming through (12-16 weeks particularly hellish), they *need* to chew. Better a Nylabone than your furniture.
{{< /product-card >}}

{{< product-card 
    title="Snuggle Puppy - Comfort Toy with Heartbeat"
    description="Soft toy with simulated heartbeat and heat pack. Mimics littermate comfort. Helps with first nights and separation anxiety."
    url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE"
    price="££"
>}}
**For the first week:** Genuinely helps some puppies settle. The heartbeat is oddly comforting. Buster loved his. Jago immediately attempted murder-by-mauling. Your mileage may vary.
{{< /product-card >}}

**Also useful:**
- Soft tug toy (for gentle play, teaches "drop it")
- Crinkle toys (auditory stimulation)
- Puzzle toys (start very easy, build difficulty)

### What to Avoid:

❌ **Tennis balls** - abrasive, too large for puppy mouths, choking hazard
❌ **Rope toys** - can unravel and cause intestinal blockages if swallowed
❌ **Squeaky toys unsupervised** - they'll rip them open and eat the squeaker
❌ **Anything smaller than a golf ball** - choking risk
❌ **Rawhide anything** - digestive nightmares, choking risk
❌ **Sticks** - splinters, mouth injuries, intestinal damage

## Cleaning & Hygiene (The Unglamorous Necessities)

### 10. Enzymatic Cleaner

Puppies will have accidents. Many, many accidents. Regular cleaners don't eliminate the scent—puppies will keep toileting in the same spots.

{{< product-card 
    title="Simple Solution Extreme Pet Stain & Odour Remover"
    description="Enzymatic formula breaks down urine proteins. Eliminates odours rather than masking. Works on carpets, wood, tile. Three times stronger than standard formula."
    url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE"
    price="££"
>}}
**Stock up:** This will be your most-used product for the first 3-4 months. Buy the largest bottle.

**How to use:** Soak the area (seriously, saturate it), leave for 10 minutes, blot up. Don't use any other cleaners first—they can set the stain.
{{< /product-card >}}

### 11. Poo Bags (Biodegradable, Ideally)

You'll need hundreds. Puppies poo approximately 47 times per day. This feels like only mild exaggeration.

{{< product-card 
    title="Earth Rated Poo Bags - Lavender Scented"
    description="Extra thick, leak-proof, lavender scented (genuinely helps). Comes on rolls that fit standard dispensers. Certified compostable."
    url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE"
    price="££"
>}}
**Buy in bulk:** Subscribe and save on Amazon. You'll go through a roll per week minimum.
{{< /product-card >}}

**Also grab a dispenser** that clips to your lead/bag. Nothing worse than reaching for a bag with a puppy mid-squat and realising they're at home on the counter.

### 12. Puppy Shampoo (Gentle, Hypoallergenic)

Frenchies have sensitive skin. Don't use human shampoo or harsh dog shampoos.

{{< product-card 
    title="Burt's Bees Puppy Shampoo (Tearless, 2-in-1)"
    description="Gentle, pH-balanced for puppies. Tearless formula. Adds shine without harsh chemicals. Buttermilk and linseed oil formula. Made from 97% natural ingredients."
    url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE"
    price="££"
>}}
**Bathing frequency:** Not more than once every 3-4 weeks unless they've rolled in something unspeakable. Over-bathing dries out skin and causes issues.

Exception: Wrinkles and ears need more frequent attention (daily/weekly), but that's spot-cleaning, not full baths.
{{< /product-card >}}

## Training & Safety Essentials

### 13. Baby Gates

To limit puppy's access to the house whilst toilet training and teaching boundaries.

{{< product-card 
    title="BabyDan Pressure Fit Safety Gate"
    description="No drilling required, adjustable width, auto-close feature. Tall enough that adult Frenchies won't jump over (not that they're athletic enough to try, but still)."
    url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE"
    price="£££"
>}}
**Where to use:** Block off stairs (puppies shouldn't use stairs until 12+ weeks, risks joint damage), rooms with hazards, kitchen during meal prep.

I keep one permanently at the top of the stairs. Buster can navigate them safely now, but Jago treats stairs like they're Everest.
{{< /product-card >}}

### 14. Puppy-Proofing Supplies

French Bulldog puppies are destructive, curious, and shockingly athletic when something forbidden is involved.

**Essential puppy-proofing:**
- Cable tidies (electrical cables are apparently delicious)
- Cupboard locks (cleaning products = poison risk)
- Remove toxic plants (lilies, azaleas, daffodils, ivy—check ASPCA list)
- Move shoes to wardrobes (they WILL eat them)
- Block access to small items (remote controls, pens, coins—choking hazards)

**Frenchie-specific concerns:**
- Block fireplace access (they'll eat coal)
- Secure bin lids (flat faces = surprisingly effective bin raiders)
- Remove or secure wires/cables (chewing risks electric shock)

The biting and chewing of hands takes some getting used to — puppy teeth are like tiny needles, and Frenchie puppies seem to view human fingers as premium chew toys.

But the scariest moment was the electric wire incident. One of the boys chewed through the power cable to the fridge. *The fridge.* Live wire, puppy teeth, could have been catastrophic. We found the chewed cable before anything happened, but it was a proper wake-up call.

After that, every cable in the house got cable-tidied, tucked behind furniture, or enclosed in protective conduit. Puppy-proofing isn't optional — it's the difference between a funny story and a tragedy.

Oh, and the midnight toilet trips. Nobody mentions that puppies need to go out in the middle of the night. Frequently. In January. In Cornwall. In the rain. With a puppy who thinks 3 AM is playtime. Good times.

## The Nice-to-Haves (If Budget Allows)

These aren't essential, but they make life easier:

### Puppy Playpen
Creates a safe enclosed space larger than a crate. Useful if you need them contained but want to give more freedom.

### Slow Feeder Bowl
Some Frenchies inhale their food and then vomit it back up. Slow feeders help. Jago has one. He hates it. But he vomits less.

### Snuggle Safe Heat Pad
Microwave heat pad that stays warm for hours. Lovely for first nights and cold weather. Safer than electric heat pads.

### Grooming Kit
Nail clippers (guillotine style), soft brush, toothbrush and dog toothpaste. Start grooming early so they tolerate it.

### First Aid Kit
Tweezers, antiseptic wipes, bandages, styptic powder (for nail bleeding), emergency vet contact details, tick removal tool.

### Pet Insurance
Not gear, but crucial. Vet bills for French Bulldogs can be eye-watering. Get insurance before anything goes wrong (pre-existing conditions won't be covered).

**Look for:**
- Lifetime cover (not annual limit reset)
- High vet fee limit (£7,000+ annually minimum)
- Covers hereditary/congenital conditions (essential for Frenchies)
- Includes dental illness (not just injury)

Buster's insurance has paid for itself three times over already.

## What You Absolutely Don't Need

Despite what pet shops want you to believe, skip these:

### Puppy Pads
Confusing for toilet training. You're teaching them it's okay to toilet indoors. Better to take them outside frequently. Exception: If you live in a high-rise flat with no garden access, they might be necessary temporarily.

### Fancy Dog Clothes (Yet)
Wait until they're fully grown. They'll outgrow puppy-sized clothes in weeks. Exception: A practical fleece/raincoat for cold weather walks is sensible.

### Expensive Collar
They'll outgrow it. You need a harness anyway (see point 1).

### Automatic Feeders/Water Fountains
Unnecessary for puppies. They need scheduled meals (3-4 times daily initially), and French Bulldogs aren't great with complicated drinking mechanisms.

### Dog Cologne/Perfume
If your dog smells, there's usually a medical reason (skin infection, ear infection, dental issues). Masking it with perfume doesn't solve the problem.

## The First Week Timeline

**DAY 1:**
- Pick up puppy with crate, harness, food, bowls already set up at home
- Let puppy explore one room, not entire house
- Offer water, small meal
- Take outside every 30-60 minutes for toilet breaks
- Begin positive crate associations (treats, meals in crate with door open)
- Expect zero sleep

**DAYS 2-3:**
- Establish toilet routine (after sleep, after meals, after play)
- Short positive interactions with crate
- Gentle play, lots of naps (puppies sleep 18-20 hours/day)
- Start basic handling (touching paws, ears, mouth gently—preparing for future grooming)
- Still expect minimal sleep

**DAYS 4-7:**
- Begin lead training indoors (puppy wearing harness for 5-minute periods)
- Continue toilet training (praise successes, ignore accidents)
- Introduce "sit" command using treats
- Practice crate training (building duration with door closed)
- Clean wrinkles daily (establish routine early)
- You might get 4 hours continuous sleep. Might.

**WEEKS 2-4:**
- First vet check (vaccinations, health check)
- Socialisation begins (once vaccine protocol allows)
- Lead walking outside (short distances, lots of rest)
- Continue training (sit, name response, "leave it")
- Establish consistent routine

## Budget Breakdown: What This Actually Costs

Let's be honest about money:

**Essential gear (before puppy arrives):**
- Harness: £25-40
- Lead: £10-15
- Crate: £40-60
- Crate bedding: £20-30
- Food/water bowls: £20-30
- Puppy food (first month): £40-60
- Treats: £15-20
- Kong: £10-15
- Nylabone chews: £10-15
- Wrinkle cleaning supplies: £15-20
- Enzymatic cleaner: £10-15
- Poo bags: £10
- Shampoo: £8-12
- ID tag: £5-10
- Baby gates: £30-60

**TOTAL ESSENTIAL SETUP:** £280-420

**First vet visit:** £150-200

**Nice-to-haves (if budget allows):** £100-250

**Realistic first-month total:** £530-870

This doesn't include the puppy purchase price (£2,000-3,000 from reputable breeders). If anyone offers you a Frenchie puppy for £500, they're either stolen or from a puppy farm. Neither option is acceptable.

## Final Thoughts: You're Ready (Nearly)

Here's what nobody tells you about French Bulldog puppies: they're simultaneously the best and worst decision you'll ever make.

Best because: they're funny, affectionate, characterful, and will love you with the intensity of a thousand suns.

Worst because: they're expensive, medically complicated, sleep-disrupting, possession-destroying little chaos goblins for the first year.

But if you've got the gear sorted, the house puppy-proofed, the routine planned, and realistic expectations... you're as ready as you'll ever be.

Buster arrived seven years ago with me thinking I was prepared. I wasn't. But we muddled through, and now he's the calmest, most dignified Frenchie you'll meet (his words, not mine).

Jago arrived three years ago. I thought, "I've done this before, I know what I'm doing." I didn't. He's still a work in progress.

You'll make mistakes. Your house will get wrecked. You'll cry with exhaustion. You'll question your life choices at 4 AM whilst cleaning up puppy diarrhoea.

And then your Frenchie puppy will snort contentedly in their sleep, or do that ridiculous butt-wiggle when they're happy, or rest their huge head on your foot, and you'll think: "Yeah. Worth it."
