If your Frenchie's face smells like a cheese counter at Waitrose, this guide is for you.

Those adorable face wrinkles are one of the things we love most about Buster and Jago — they give them that perpetually concerned expression, as if they're deeply worried about the state of the economy or whether we've remembered to buy their favourite treats (spoiler: it's always the treats). But here's the thing about those gorgeous folds: they need regular cleaning, or they quickly become breeding grounds for bacteria, yeast, and what can only be described as *biological mysteries*.

We speak from experience. There was a fortnight last summer when we got a bit slack with Jago's wrinkle routine — busy with work, you know how it is — and he developed what we can only describe as "eau de Stilton." The vet was very polite about it. We were mortified.

Learning how to clean French Bulldog wrinkles properly is one of those essential skills that separates the panicked Googling at 10 PM ("is my dog's face supposed to smell like this") from the confident "I've got this" energy. The good news? It's genuinely straightforward once you know what you're doing, takes less time than making a cup of tea, and most Frenchies actually quite enjoy the attention. Jago treats it like a spa appointment. Buster tolerates it with the quiet dignity of someone who knows we're doing this for his own good.

This guide shares everything we've learned from caring for two very different French Bulldogs here in Cornwall, including the products that actually work, the mistakes we made (see: Stilton incident), and the little tricks that make the whole process less like wrestling a small, determined pig.

## Why French Bulldogs Need Wrinkle Cleaning

French Bulldogs have those signature deep facial folds because of their brachycephalic (flat-faced) structure. Someone, somewhere in breeding history, looked at a perfectly normal dog face and thought, "You know what this needs? More folds." And here we are, with dogs whose faces look like someone scrunched up a velvet cushion, then made it sentient.

Whilst these wrinkles are undeniably charming and make excellent hiding spots for treats they're "saving for later" (Jago's speciality), they create warm, moist environments — basically five-star hotels for bacteria and yeast, if bacteria and yeast were the sort of guests who trash the minibar and never leave.

Here's what happens when wrinkles aren't cleaned regularly:

**Moisture buildup**: Tear stains, drool, and general dampness get trapped in the folds. In our experience, the wrinkle that runs down from the nose is particularly prone to staying wet. It's like having a tiny, permanently damp flannel attached to your face. Buster's stays relatively dry. Jago's could water a small plant.

**Bacteria and yeast overgrowth**: That moisture creates the perfect breeding ground. This is what causes the distinctive "yeasty" smell that some Frenchies develop. You know the one. It's not quite bread, not quite cheese, entirely unpleasant. If you've smelled it, you'll never forget it.

**Skin fold dermatitis**: Without proper French Bulldog wrinkle care, the skin can become inflamed, red, and painful. We've seen this happen when we've slacked off on Jago's routine (the aforementioned Stilton incident of 2025, never to be repeated).

**Infection**: In severe cases, untreated irritation can lead to a French Bulldog skin fold infection that requires veterinary treatment, antibiotics, and a level of judgement from your vet that makes you feel like you've failed as a parent.

The deep wrinkle between the nose and eyes is especially vulnerable because tears naturally drain there. If you've noticed reddish-brown tear stains, that's a sign moisture is accumulating. It's also a sign that your Frenchie has mastered the art of looking perpetually heartbroken, even when they're perfectly content.

This article shares our personal experience with Frenchie face fold cleaning, learned through trial, error, and one regrettable cheese-scented summer. Always consult your vet for medical concerns, particularly if you notice signs of infection like pus, bleeding, or your dog showing pain when touched. Your vet has seen worse. Probably.

## How Often Should You Clean Your Frenchie's Wrinkles?

Honestly, this depends on your individual dog, but here's what works for us — and by "works" we mean "keeps the vets from giving us sympathetic looks."

**Daily quick wipe**: We do a gentle wipe of Buster and Jago's main facial folds every single day, usually in the evening after their last trip outside. This takes literally 30 seconds per dog. Buster sits there like we're performing a professional facial treatment. Jago acts like we're attempting amateur surgery without anaesthetic. Same process, entirely different species.

**Deep clean**: 2-3 times per week, we do a more thorough clean, getting into every fold and applying protective balm afterwards. This is when we discover what Jago's been storing in there. So far: kibble fragments, garden debris, what might have been a leaf, and once, inexplicably, a bit of Buster's fur.

**After meals**: A quick wipe of the face wrinkles if they've been particularly messy with their food. Jago wears more dinner than he eats. We've made peace with this.

**After walks**: Especially on wet days here in Cornwall (so, most days, let's be honest), we'll wipe their faces when we get home. Mud and moisture get trapped in the folds, and nobody wants a dog who smells like a damp hiking boot.

We do ours in the evening, on the sofa whilst they're in full relaxation mode. It's part of the wind-down routine now — walk, dinner, wrinkle cleaning, general existential contemplation of the day's events (them, not us. Well, us too, if we're honest). Evening works because they're calmer, more cooperative, and less likely to immediately go outside and ruin our good work by investigating something suspicious in the garden.

Jago needs daily attention — his wrinkles are deeper and he produces more moisture (we don't ask why, we've stopped questioning Jago's biological mysteries). Buster can sometimes stretch to every other day, but we keep them on the same schedule because it's easier to remember "both dogs, every evening" than to track individual schedules like we're running a very small, very hairy hotel.

Some Frenchies need more frequent cleaning than others. Dogs with deeper wrinkles, those prone to heavy tear staining, or Frenchies who drool more will need daily attention. Jago's wrinkles are deeper than Buster's, which means more maintenance. It's like having one child who needs constant supervision and another who just quietly gets on with things. If you start noticing any smell or redness, increase your cleaning frequency before your Frenchie starts clearing rooms.

{{< callout type="tip" title="Buster's Tip" >}}
Make it part of your routine rather than a special event. Buster gets his wrinkles cleaned at the same time every day, and now he actually comes and presents his face when it's "wrinkle time" — like a tiny, dignified patron at a gentlemen's club requesting his customary shave. Routine breeds cooperation. Also, the treats help.

## What You'll Need for Wrinkle Cleaning

The good news is you don't need a huge arsenal of products. You're cleaning wrinkles, not launching a military operation. Here's what we keep in our Frenchie grooming kit:

### Essential Supplies:
- **Wrinkle wipes or cotton pads**: We prefer unscented, hypoallergenic wipes specifically designed for dogs. We learned this after trying human face wipes. Once. Jago's expression alone told us never again.
- **Clean, dry cloth or gauze**: For drying. Step 4 is drying. We cannot stress this enough. We've bolded it, underlined it, and if we could reach through your screen and hand you a towel, we would.
- **Wrinkle balm or protective paste**: To create a barrier after cleaning
- **Treats**: For positive reinforcement, bribery, and maintaining the illusion that this is all *their* idea

### Optional but Helpful:
- **Coconut oil**: Organic, unrefined — works as a natural antibacterial and makes your Frenchie smell like a Bounty bar
- **Antifungal wipes**: For when you spot early signs of yeast and want to nip it in the bud before it becomes a full-blown cheese situation
- **Small torch**: Sounds silly, but it helps you see into the deeper folds. Jago's nose wrinkle is like the Mariana Trench. You need proper lighting.

The most important thing is that whatever you use is gentle, unscented, and won't irritate your Frenchie's sensitive skin. We've learned the hard way that products containing alcohol or harsh fragrances are a definite no-go. Buster sneezed for ten minutes straight. We felt like monsters.

## Step-by-Step Guide: How to Clean French Bulldog Wrinkles

Right, let's get into the actual process. This is our tried-and-tested routine that works for both our boys, despite their best efforts to make it as dramatic as possible.

### Step 1: Gather Your Supplies and Get Comfortable

Set up somewhere comfortable with good lighting. We usually do this on the sofa with the dog sitting between our legs, but you might prefer a table if your Frenchie is particularly wriggly. Jago is particularly wriggly. Buster arranges himself like a sphinx and waits patiently for us to finish.

Have everything within arm's reach:
- Wipes or cotton pads
- Dry cloth
- Balm
- Treats (the good ones, not the dental chews they pretend to like but secretly hate)

The key is to make this quick and positive. You're aiming for "pleasant daily ritual," not "hostage negotiation."

We do this on the sofa with them between our legs — feels less clinical than using a table, and they're already in their natural habitat (the sofa is 70% theirs anyway, we're just occasional visitors). Good lighting is crucial — we've got a lamp nearby because trying to clean wrinkles in atmospheric mood lighting is how you miss things.

Keeping them still: Buster doesn't require keeping still. He simply *is* still, like a distinguished statue who occasionally snorts. Jago requires strategic treat placement within his eyeline but just out of reach. It's bribery. We're fine with it. This isn't the time for moral high ground.

{{< callout type="tip" title="Jago's Tip" >}}
Jago used to hate wrinkle cleaning until we started giving him a special treat ONLY during this time. Now he actually looks forward to it. The treat is freeze-dried liver. He would sell us out to bandits for freeze-dried liver. Find what motivates your Frenchie, then exploit it shamelessly.
{{< /callout >}}

### Step 2: Gently Open the Folds

Starting with the deepest wrinkle (usually the one running down from between the eyes), use your fingers to gently separate the fold. Be gentle — this skin is delicate, and you don't want to cause any discomfort. Think of it like opening a very small, very precious book. A book that might lick you.

Some folds are shallow, but others (especially that nose rope) can be surprisingly deep. Take your time exploring all the folds:
- The main nose rope (between eyes, down to nose) — Jago's is Grand Canyon-esque
- Wrinkles beside the nose — where mysteries live
- Folds under the eyes — the tear stain headquarters
- Any wrinkles around the muzzle — food storage facility
- Don't forget the chin folds if your Frenchie has them — Buster doesn't, Jago has one that collects water when he drinks

If your dog pulls away, take a break, give a treat, and try again. Never force it. A stressed Frenchie is an uncooperative Frenchie, and they're surprisingly strong when they want to be.

### Step 3: Wipe Clean

Take your wrinkle wipe or cotton pad and gently clean inside each fold. Use a fresh section of the wipe or a new pad for each fold to avoid spreading bacteria around. We're cleaning, not redistributing the problem like some sort of bacterial UPS service.

What you're removing:
- Dirt and debris
- Tear stains (that reddish-brown gunk that looks alarming but is usually harmless)
- Any moisture
- Food particles (Jago's contribution to science)
- General grime, the origin of which we try not to think about

You might be surprised by what comes out, especially if this is your first time doing a thorough clean. Don't be alarmed if the wipe looks like you've been cleaning a chimney. That's exactly what you want to remove! The first time we did Jago's properly, we went through four cotton pads. We didn't even know that much dirt *could* fit in a face.

Work methodically through each wrinkle, being extra gentle around the eyes and nose. If you encounter any crusty buildup, don't scrape it — moisten it with the wipe and let it soften first. Scraping leads to irritation, which leads to a grumpy Frenchie, which leads to you sleeping on the sofa because they've claimed your side of the bed in protest.

![Hands gently cleaning a French Bulldog's face wrinkles with a wipe](/images/breed/cleaning-frenchie-wrinkles-action.jpg)
*Gentle, thorough cleaning is key*

### Step 4: Dry Thoroughly (The Most Important Step!)

Here's where many people go wrong, and where we went spectacularly wrong during the Stilton Incident: they clean the wrinkles but don't dry them properly. 

**This is absolutely critical.** 

If you leave moisture in those folds, you've basically just created a lovely damp environment for bacteria to thrive. You've given them a spa. With heated pools. All-inclusive.

Using a clean, dry cloth or gauze, gently pat inside each fold until it's completely dry. Not damp-dry. Not mostly-dry. Not "it'll air-dry." BONE DRY. We go through each wrinkle we just cleaned, making sure there's no dampness left at all. Zero. None. If we could use a hairdryer on the lowest setting without traumatising the dog, we would.

This step is non-negotiable. Seriously. If we had to choose between cleaning or drying, we'd choose drying every time. A dirty but dry wrinkle is better than a clean but damp one. This is the hill we're dying on.

{{< callout type="warning" title="Watch Out" >}}
Never leave wrinkles damp after cleaning. The moisture will cause more problems than the dirt you've just removed. This is how we learned about skin fold dermatitis. Don't be like us in Summer 2025. Always ensure each fold is thoroughly dried. Your Frenchie's face should be drier than British humour.
{{< /callout >}}

### Step 5: Apply Protective Balm

Once everything is clean and completely dry (we cannot stress the "completely" part enough), we apply a thin layer of protective balm to the deep wrinkles. This creates a barrier that helps repel moisture and prevents irritation. Think of it as a tiny, invisible raincoat for your dog's face folds.

You only need a tiny amount — a little goes a long way. We typically apply balm to:
- The main nose rope
- Any particularly deep folds (Jago's entire face, essentially)
- Areas prone to tear staining

Gently work the balm into the fold without over-applying. You don't want your Frenchie looking like they've face-planted into a tub of Vaseline. We learned this when we got a bit enthusiastic with Buster's first application. He looked like a glazed doughnut. A dignified, judgemental glazed doughnut.

Not every wrinkle needs balm every time. For shallow folds or during daily quick cleans, just the cleaning and drying is usually sufficient.

### The Final Step: Reward!

End the session with treats and praise. Lay it on thick. Act like they've just performed open-heart surgery rather than sitting still for 90 seconds. We want our Frenchies to associate wrinkle cleaning with positive experiences, not something to hide under the bed from.

Jago gets his freeze-dried liver. Buster gets a dental stick (which he actually likes, the weirdo). Both get told they're very good boys. Buster accepts this as his due. Jago acts like he's just won an Oscar.

Buster took to it immediately with his usual dignified acceptance of necessary grooming protocols. He understood we were helping, he cooperated, he expected treats. A gentleman throughout.

Jago, however. Oh, Jago. The first few weeks were *dramatic*. He'd thrash his head side to side like we were attempting something deeply offensive rather than cleaning his face. Full-body resistance. Snorting protests. The works. We persisted with treats, patience, and the quiet determination of people who'd smelled the alternative.

It took about three weeks before he stopped fighting it. Now he tolerates it with only minor grumbling, mainly because he knows the freeze-dried liver is coming. We consider this a massive victory.

## Signs of Infection to Watch For

Even with regular cleaning, sometimes issues crop up. We're vigilant about this because of... well, you know. The incident. We don't talk about the incident.

**Red flags that need vet attention:**
- Persistent redness or inflammation that doesn't improve with cleaning
- Foul smell that doesn't shift (we mean *really* foul, beyond the usual "dog face" scent)
- Pus or discharge (if anything is oozing, you're beyond home treatment)
- Bleeding or raw skin
- Your Frenchie showing pain when you touch their face — flinching, pulling away, or giving you *the look*
- Excessive scratching or rubbing of the face on furniture
- Swelling in or around the wrinkles

**Early warning signs we address immediately:**
- Stronger than usual yeasty smell (think bread that's gone off)
- Slight redness after cleaning
- More tear staining than normal
- Dampness that returns very quickly after drying, like the wrinkle is producing its own weather system

If we catch these early signs, we increase cleaning frequency and sometimes switch to antifungal wipes for a few days. If there's no improvement within 48 hours, or if any of the red flags appear, we book a vet appointment. Pride is not worth a full-blown skin infection.

{{< callout type="vet-note" title="Vet Note" >}}
Skin fold infections can progress quickly in French Bulldogs. If you're ever unsure, err on the side of caution and consult your vet. It's always better to check and be told everything's fine than to let an infection take hold. Your vet will not judge you. Well, they might a bit, but they'll help your dog, and that's what matters.
{{< /callout >}}

The good news is that with consistent cleaning, infections are rare. We've been lucky with Buster and Jago since we got our act together — regular maintenance keeps problems at bay, and we've achieved the holy grail: Frenchies whose faces smell like... nothing. Just dog. Normal dog. It's revolutionary.

## Our Favourite Wrinkle Care Products

After trying various products over the years (including some absolute disasters we won't name, but rhymes with "human baby wipes"), here's what actually earns a spot in our grooming kit:

### Best Wrinkle Wipes

{{< product-card name="Squishface Wrinkle Wipes" price="£13.99" rating="4.8" url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE" pros="Specifically designed for wrinkles,Gentle on sensitive skin,Perfect size for Frenchie faces,No harsh chemicals" cons="Slightly more expensive,Can't choose pack size" >}}

{{< tested-badge >}}

These are what we actually use on Buster and Jago. Specifically formulated for wrinkly breeds, they're gentle enough for Buster's sensitive skin and effective enough for Jago's... everything. The wipes are perfectly sized for getting into those deep folds without needing to fold them seventeen times. We've tried cheaper alternatives (we're not made of money), but we keep coming back to these. They work, they don't irritate, and they don't smell like a chemical factory exploded.

{{< affiliate-button url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE" text="Check Price on Amazon" >}}

**Alternative option:**

{{< product-card name="Earthbath Hypoallergenic Grooming Wipes" price="£12.99" rating="4.5" url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE" pros="Fragrance-free,Plant-based,Large wipes,Good value" cons="Can be slightly dry,Not individually wrapped,Not wrinkle-specific" >}}

A solid budget-friendly option that we used before discovering Squishface. They're gentle enough for sensitive skin (Buster's face, Jago's entire existence), and the size is perfect for getting into Frenchie wrinkles without needing seventeen of them. We've used these on both boys for over a year with zero irritation. They don't smell of anything, which initially seemed boring but is actually perfect. Your dog's face shouldn't smell like a lavender field. Or anything, really.

{{< affiliate-button url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE" text="Check Price on Amazon" >}}

### Best Wrinkle Balm

{{< product-card name="Natural Dog Company Wrinkle Balm" price="£16.99" rating="4.7" url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE" pros="All-natural ingredients,Long-lasting,Actually works" cons="Bit pricey,Can be messy if over-applied" >}}

{{< tested-badge >}}

This stuff is brilliant. It's made with organic ingredients including shea butter and coconut oil, and a little tin lasts absolutely ages because you need about a pea-sized amount total for both dogs. We apply this 2-3 times per week, and it's made a noticeable difference in keeping Jago's deeper wrinkles healthy. Worth every penny, even though it costs more than some of our own skincare products. Don't think about that too hard.

{{< affiliate-button url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE" text="Check Price on Amazon" >}}

### Budget-Friendly Alternative

**Organic Coconut Oil**: Seriously. A jar of good quality, unrefined organic coconut oil works beautifully as a protective barrier. It's what we used before discovering wrinkle balm, and it's still our backup option. Just make sure it's pure coconut oil with no additives, and prepare for your dog to smell faintly tropical. Jago smelled like a piña colada for a fortnight. Not entirely unpleasant, if we're honest.

### For Problem Areas

{{< product-card name="Veterinary Formula Clinical Care Antiseptic & Antifungal Wipes" price="£9.99" rating="4.3" url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE" pros="Effective for yeast,Medicated when needed,Good value" cons="Not for daily use,Stronger smell" >}}

We keep these on hand for those times when we notice early signs of yeast or irritation. They're not for everyday use — they're the nuclear option, the big guns, the "things are getting concerning and we need to sort this before it becomes A Problem." Brilliant for nipping issues in the bud. These are what rescued us from the Stilton Incident before it required actual veterinary intervention.

{{< affiliate-button url="AFFILIATE_LINK_HERE" text="Check Price on Amazon" >}}

We've tried a frankly embarrassing number of products. The local pet shop in town stocks some eco-friendly bamboo wipes that we wanted to love (sustainability! supporting local business!) but they fell apart mid-wipe. Jago looked at us like we'd failed him personally.

The Squishface wipes are the ones we actually buy repeatedly, which is the highest praise we can give. When you find something that works with French Bulldog wrinkles, you stick with it. This isn't the time for experimental purchasing.

## Tips From Our Experience

After caring for Buster and Jago's wrinkles for years (and making every possible mistake along the way), here are the little things we've learned that make a real difference:

**Make it routine, not random**: Pick the same time each day. Ours is after their evening walk, before dinner. Now it's just part of the schedule, like tea at 4 PM or feeling mildly anxious about the weather forecast. There's no resistance because it's simply What Happens.

**Start young**: If you have a puppy, start gentle wrinkle cleaning early even if they don't really need it yet. Getting them used to face handling makes everything easier later. Buster was started young. Jago came to us at six months, wrinkle-cleaning-naïve. You can guess which one is easier to deal with.

**Watch the weather**: Humid days mean more moisture in the wrinkles. Here in Cornwall, when it's particularly damp (so, Tuesday through Monday), we're extra vigilant about drying thoroughly. Your dog's face should not double as a barometer, but here we are.

**Different dogs, different needs**: Buster has shallower wrinkles than Jago, so he needs less intensive care. Don't assume a one-size-fits-all approach will work. It's like having children — one will be perfectly content with a goldfish, the other needs constant supervision and has somehow got their head stuck in a fence. Not that we're saying Jago is the fence-head-stuck one. But we're not *not* saying it.

**Keep nails trimmed**: This applies to both you and your dog! Long nails (human or canine) can scratch that delicate skin. We learned this when Jago caught his own nose with a back paw during an enthusiastic scratch. There was drama. There were tears. (His, not ours. Mostly his.)

**Lighting matters**: Good lighting helps you see into the folds properly. We've missed early redness before simply because we weren't looking carefully enough. Now we do wrinkle checks by the window. The neighbours probably think we're conducting some sort of ritualistic face worship. We've made peace with this.

**Don't over-clean**: Yes, really. Over-enthusiastic cleaning can actually cause irritation. If the wrinkles look healthy and smell fine, you don't need to scrub them raw. This isn't Lady Macbeth. A gentle daily wipe is fine. Save the deep forensic investigation for 2-3 times a week.

**The sniff test**: A healthy wrinkle should smell of basically nothing, or faintly of dog. If you're getting that yeasty, cheesy smell, it's time to step up your cleaning game. If you're getting a smell that makes you recoil, you've already left it too long. We're not judging — we've been there — but sort it out before guests arrive.

**Positive association is everything**: If your Frenchie thinks wrinkle cleaning is punishment, you're in for years of wrestling. Make it pleasant. Chat to them. Give treats. Act like this is the highlight of your day. Buster now genuinely seems to enjoy it. Jago tolerates it because liver. We call this a win.

{{< callout type="tip" title="Jago's Tip" >}}
Jago used to hate having his face touched until we started incorporating it into play and cuddle time. Now gentle face handling is normal to him, so wrinkle cleaning isn't a battle — it's just another thing that happens, like breakfast or the eternal question of whether that noise outside warrants barking. (It does. It always does. According to Jago.)
{{< /callout >}}

The most challenging moment was definitely those first three weeks with Jago and his full-body head-thrashing protest routine. He'd wait until we'd just cleaned a wrinkle, then shake his entire head violently, flinging moisture and wipe debris everywhere. It was like trying to clean a very small, very determined washing machine mid-spin cycle.

The breakthrough came when we discovered that doing it at the same time every evening, in the same spot, with the same treats, finally convinced him this wasn't a random attack but a routine. Routine is everything with these dogs. They're small, snorting creatures of habit.

*A clean, happy Frenchie — worth the effort every time*

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How often should I clean my French Bulldog's wrinkles?**

At minimum, do a quick daily wipe of the main facial folds, with a deeper clean 2-3 times per week. Some Frenchies with particularly deep wrinkles or heavy tear staining may need more frequent attention. Jago is daily. Buster could probably skip a day if needed, but we keep them on the same schedule for our own sanity. Watch your individual dog and adjust accordingly. If they smell like cheese, you've answered your own question.

**Can I use baby wipes to clean wrinkle folds?**

We wouldn't recommend it, and not just because we tried it once and Jago sneezed seven times in a row then gave us a look that could wither houseplants. Baby wipes often contain fragrances, lotions, and ingredients that can irritate a dog's sensitive skin. Stick to wipes specifically formulated for dogs, or use plain damp cotton pads with water. Your baby might appreciate scented wipes. Your Frenchie's face will not.

**What causes the red/brown staining in my Frenchie's wrinkles?**

This is typically tear staining caused by a combination of tears, saliva, and yeast. The reddish-brown colour comes from porphyrins in the tears. It looks dramatic — like your dog has been crying rust — but it's usually harmless. Regular cleaning helps manage it, though some Frenchies are more prone to staining than others. Diet and allergies can also play a role. Jago stains more than Buster. We suspect this is because Jago has emotions about *everything*.

**My Frenchie's wrinkles smell bad even after cleaning. What should I do?**

A persistent smell suggests a yeast or bacterial infection that needs more than standard cleaning. Try antifungal wipes for a few days, ensure you're drying thoroughly (we mean *thoroughly* — think "desert," think "the Sahara"), and if there's no improvement within 48 hours, consult your vet. Sometimes medicated treatment is needed. Don't be embarrassed. Your vet has seen worse. Probably. And if they haven't, you'll have given them a story for the Christmas party.

**Should I use powder in my French Bulldog's wrinkles?**

We don't use powder and wouldn't recommend it. Whilst some people swear by cornstarch-based powders, they can create buildup and actually trap moisture if not used perfectly. It's like trying to dry your floor by spreading flour on it. Technically absorbing moisture, yes, but creating a different problem. A good protective balm is a safer bet in our experience. Less faff, better results, won't make your dog look like they've been attacked by the contents of a baking cupboard.

**Can wrinkle infections spread to other parts of the body?**

Yes, yeast and bacteria can potentially spread, and your Frenchie might transfer them to other areas through scratching or rubbing. This is another reason why catching and treating wrinkle issues early is so important. Also, if you have multiple dogs, they can share the problem. We haven't had this happen, but we're vigilant. Buster and Jago already share everything else — toys, beds, our undivided attention — we'd rather they didn't share skin infections too.

## Conclusion

Learning how to clean French Bulldog wrinkles properly is one of those essential care tasks that becomes second nature once you've got the hang of it — like making tea, or apologising when you're not entirely sure what for. The key points to remember:

- Clean daily, deep clean 2-3 times weekly
- Always dry thoroughly — this is genuinely the most critical step (have we mentioned this enough? We'll mention it again: DRY THOROUGHLY)
- Use gentle, dog-specific products
- Watch for early signs of irritation or infection
- Make it a positive routine for your Frenchie
- Don't let it slide, even when you're busy, tired, or convinced it'll be fine for another day (it won't)

Those adorable wrinkles are part of what makes our French Bulldogs so characterful and lovable. They're also high-maintenance little skin folds that require regular attention. Taking a few minutes each day to care for them properly means fewer vet visits, a happier dog, one less thing to worry about, and a home that doesn't smell faintly of cheese. These are all good things.

Buster and Jago's wrinkles stay fresh and healthy with this routine, and we're confident it'll work for your Frenchie too. Start today, be consistent, and you'll quickly find that wrinkle care becomes just another part of your day — like those expectant stares when it's dinner time, or the way they somehow always need to go out right when you've sat down with a cup of tea.

We spent £200 on a premium orthopaedic bed for them, by the way. They sleep on the doormat. Every night. But their wrinkles are immaculate, and honestly, that's the victory we're claiming.

For more essential French Bulldog care tips, check out our guides on [French Bulldog Health Issues](#), [French Bulldog Grooming Guide](#), and [Best French Bulldog Supplements](#).

Here in Cornwall, keeping on top of wrinkle cleaning is non-negotiable. The damp air means moisture accumulates faster, beach trips mean sand gets everywhere (including, mysteriously, in Buster's nose wrinkle despite him not actually touching the sand), and muddy woodland walks are our default setting from October to April.

But honestly? Once you've got the routine down, it's just part of life with Frenchies. Like the snoring, the selective hearing, and the way they both insist on sitting on your feet despite having approximately forty cushions and three dog beds available.

We don't really own our boys. They are a part of our family and come everywhere with us in Cornwall. Which means their wrinkles come too, and we're responsible for keeping them clean, healthy, and smelling significantly better than cheese.

Your Frenchie's wrinkles are part of what makes them uniquely, wonderfully ridiculous. Take care of them properly, and you'll have a happy, healthy dog with a face that looks permanently concerned about something important. Which, let's be honest, is exactly what we signed up for.
