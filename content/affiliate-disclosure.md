## Affiliate Disclosure

**Last updated:** February 15, 2026

### Our Commitment to Transparency

The Frenchie Guide participates in affiliate marketing programmes. This means we may earn a commission when you click on certain links and purchase products. This doesn't cost you anything extra — the price you pay is exactly the same as if you'd gone directly to the retailer.

### How It Works

When we link to a product on Amazon, pet product retailers, or other online stores, these may be **affiliate links**. If you click the link and make a purchase, we receive a small percentage of the sale at no additional cost to you.

For example:
- We're part of the **Amazon Associates Programme** and other affiliate networks.
- When you buy something through our Amazon links, Amazon pays us a small commission.
- This helps us keep the site running and allows us to continue testing products and creating helpful content.

### What We Recommend

Here's our promise to you:

✅ **We only recommend products we've actually used** — Buster and Jago test everything we feature.  
✅ **We're honest about what works and what doesn't** — If a product is rubbish, we'll tell you.  
✅ **Affiliate earnings don't influence our opinions** — We'd rather earn nothing than recommend something poor.  
✅ **We disclose all affiliate relationships** — You'll always know when a link is an affiliate link.

### How We Use Affiliate Income

The income we earn from affiliate links helps us:
- Test new products for our dogs
- Pay for web hosting and site maintenance
- Create detailed, helpful content
- Keep the site ad-free (or minimal ads)

### Your Choice

You're never obligated to use our affiliate links. If you prefer, you can:
- Search for the product yourself
- Buy it elsewhere
- Use our recommendations as a starting point for your own research

We're just grateful you're here and find our content useful!

### Legal Compliance

We comply with:
- **FTC Guidelines** (United States Federal Trade Commission)
- **ASA CAP Code** (UK Advertising Standards Authority)
- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)

All sponsored content, if any, will be clearly marked as "Sponsored" or "Ad."
